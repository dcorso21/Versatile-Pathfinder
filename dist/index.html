          Dijkstras is the simplest of the sorting algorithms. It will visit each node
          in the order in which they are found to be adjacent to the already visited.
          Dijkstras algorithm is seen as a standard in pathfinding, but can be slow with larger areas to scan.
          This algorithm does guarantee the shortest path.
        </div>
        <div class="astar algo-desc">
          A* is an algorithm that looks at number of steps taken, 
          and the euclidean distance from the current cell to the destination. 
          It creates a value from the sum of these two factors that it 
          refers to as <em>f</em>. A* Does guarantee the shortest path and is often credited as 
          the most efficent way to do so.
        </div>
        <div class="greedy algo-desc">
          Greedy is an algorithm that looks at number of steps taken, 
          and the euclidean distance from the current cell to the destination. 
          Like A*, it creates a value from the sum of these two factors that it 
          refers to as <em>f</em>. However the distance is highly prioritized 
          over the steps taken, causing the algorithm to lurch forward "greedily". 
          Greedy does NOT guarantee the shortest path.
        </div>
        <div class="dfSearch algo-desc">
          Depth First Search is an algorithm that always chooses a new neighbor 
          as opposed to those which have waiting in the queue to be visited. It does not 
          take into account where the end node is and will meander until it stumbles across it.
          As the visualizer will show, this algorithm, while useful in other applications, 
          is not optimal for pathfinding and does NOT guarantee the shortest path.
